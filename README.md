# Wellcourse Platform

### Introduction:
This platform is mainly about student interaction and sharing resources to help peers in their studies. 
Students post their notes, demos, and documents to the channel that are related to the subject and then be viewed by other users.

### Usage:
Press 'publish' on the top left corner and select the channel (subject), then edit your note!
You can choose to add plugins that are exclusive to the subject for a better demonstration. 

While editing texts, you can also select different fonts and sizes. Also, there are code and LaTeX editors for STEM subjects to make
your notes more lucid.
